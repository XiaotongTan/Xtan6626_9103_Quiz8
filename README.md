"Helix (2020)" (an AudioVisual Installation Directed by KnovCompile)
*A Source of Inspiration*
I am attracted by the dynamic interaction of light and shadow, which creates a visual flow and change. When the ribbon of light takes on a wavy shape, this change of light and shadow reminds me of the softness and fluidity of fabric, and the effect when it flutters or falls to the ground is a reminder of satin.
*How the Plan is Incorporated into the Project?*
I can write code to simulate the dynamic changes of the light strips, providing users with a more engaging and varied visual experience.
